Project Overview
This project aims to develop a Weather Forecasting System that predicts temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation based on historical and real-time weather data. The system leverages machine learning models to enhance accuracy and provide valuable insights for agriculture, disaster management, and everyday weather predictions.

Features
✅ Real-time Data Processing – Fetch real-time weather data using APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
✅ Machine Learning-based Predictions – Train ML models for forecasting temperature, rainfall, and humidity trends.
✅ Data Visualization – Generate interactive weather dashboards and trend reports.
✅ Geographical Analysis – Predict weather conditions for different regions using geospatial data.
✅ User Interface – A web-based or app-based UI for user-friendly access to forecasts.

📌 Problem Statement
Accurate weather prediction is crucial for multiple industries, including agriculture, transportation, and disaster preparedness. Traditional weather prediction models often struggle with accuracy due to dynamic climate conditions. Challenges include:

❌ Unreliable short-term forecasts – Rapidly changing climate patterns reduce the accuracy of weather models.
❌ Inadequate disaster prediction – Poor forecasts for extreme weather events like storms and floods.
❌ Lack of accessible insights – Complex weather data is not user-friendly for the general public.

Solution
This project aims to build a data-driven weather forecasting model using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical data, sensor data, and real-time weather updates, the system will provide accurate, localized, and easy-to-understand weather forecasts.
