## 🔄 Data Preprocessing  

### **1️⃣ Data Collection**  
Gather data from **weather stations, APIs, or historical datasets**. Key features include:  

- **Temperature (°C)** 🌡  
- **Humidity (%)** 💧  
- **Wind Speed (km/h)** 🌬  
- **Pressure (hPa)** 🏔  
- **Precipitation (mm)** ☔  

### **2️⃣ Handling Missing Data**  
Detect missing values:  
```python
df.isnull().sum()


📍 Strategies:
✔ Numerical Data: Impute with mean/median/mode.
✔ Categorical Data: Fill with mode or "Unknown".
✔ Drop Rows/Columns: If missing data >30%.

3️⃣ Feature Engineering
📍 Create new features:

Moving Averages (7-day, 30-day trends).
Temperature difference between days.
Season classification (Winter, Summer, Rainy).
📍 Encoding categorical variables:

python
Copy
Edit
# One-hot encoding for categorical data
df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['season'])
4️⃣ Data Splitting for Training & Testing
python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
📈 Machine Learning Model Development
1️⃣ Model Selection
🟢 Linear Regression: For basic temperature prediction.
🟢 Random Forest: For multi-variable forecasting.
🟢 LSTM (Deep Learning): For time-series forecasting.

2️⃣ Model Training & Evaluation
Train the model:

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
Evaluate performance:

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
