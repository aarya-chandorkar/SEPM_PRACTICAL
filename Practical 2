Project OverviewThis project aims to develop a Weather Forecasting System that predicts temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation based on historical and real-time weather data. The system leverages machine learning models to enhance accuracy and provide valuable insights for agriculture, disaster management, and everyday weather predictions.

Features✅ Real-time Data Processing – Fetch real-time weather data using APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).✅ Machine Learning-based Predictions – Train ML models for forecasting temperature, rainfall, and humidity trends.✅ Data Visualization – Generate interactive weather dashboards and trend reports.✅ Geographical Analysis – Predict weather conditions for different regions using geospatial data.✅ User Interface – A web-based or app-based UI for user-friendly access to forecasts.

📌 Problem StatementAccurate weather prediction is crucial for multiple industries, including agriculture, transportation, and disaster preparedness. Traditional weather prediction models often struggle with accuracy due to dynamic climate conditions. Challenges include:

❌ Unreliable short-term forecasts – Rapidly changing climate patterns reduce the accuracy of weather models.❌ Inadequate disaster prediction – Poor forecasts for extreme weather events like storms and floods.❌ Lack of accessible insights – Complex weather data is not user-friendly for the general public.

SolutionThis project aims to build a data-driven weather forecasting model using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical data, sensor data, and real-time weather updates, the system will provide accurate, localized, and easy-to-understand weather forecasts.
